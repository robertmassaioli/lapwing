My dictionary order:

user.json -> flatten the user dictionary
modes.json -> all plover mode commands
commands.json -> all plover commands
jeff-numbers -> Jeff style numbers
lapwing-uk-additions -> I write in UK spelling mos of the time and it should take precedence
lapwing-prefixed-proper-nouns -> I prefer to use a prefix so that I can also use Jeff numbers
lapwing-nonprefixed-proper-nouns (disabled) ->just in case I ever decide to stop using Jeff numbers
lapwing-base -> the majority of the words that I use.
Jeff-show-stroke -> so that I can see the words that I'm trying to write
jeff-phrasing -> so that I can go faster if I need to, not ready for it yet but it is there

That is what I should recreate if I need to regen.
